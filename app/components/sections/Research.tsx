    overview: "This paper describes the problem of intelligent paper grouping and its mathematical model. By optimizing and improving the traditional dynamic programming algorithm, its space complexity is reduced from O (nb) to O (b). At the same time, the flexibility of dynamic programming algorithm is increased by using marker function and tracking algorithm, and the result composition is tracked to obtain the optimal solution. Finally, through several experiments, the improved dynamic programming algorithm is compared with the greedy algorithm and brute force algorithm, and it is found that the improved dynamic programming algorithm has a very good result and is with high efficiency when applied to the simple test paper. It is the most recommended algorithm among the two algorithms compared in this paper.",

    description: "This paper designs a heterogeneous ensemble model by weighting the factorization machine (FM) and deep neural networks (DNN), which can efficiently extract low-order intersections and high-order intersections.",
    overview: "Credit scoring is a very critical task for banks and other financial institutions, and it has become an important evaluation metric to distinguish potential defaulting users. In this paper, we propose a credit score prediction method based on feature transformation and ensemble model, which is essentially a cascade approach. The feature transformation process consisting of boosting trees (BT) and auto-encoders (AE) is employed to replace manual feature engineering and to solve the data imbalance problem. For the classification process, this paper designs a heterogeneous ensemble model by weighting the factorization machine (FM) and deep neural networks (DNN), which can efficiently extract low-order intersections and high-order intersections. Comprehensive experiments were conducted on two standard datasets and the results demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms existing credit scoring models in accuracy.",

    description: "The network model with the best results and the classifier were selected for combination. An accuracy of 93.39% was achieved on the pig speech classification task, while the AUC also reached 0.99163, demonstrating the superiority of the method. This study contributes to the direction of computer vision and acoustics by recognizing the sound of pigs.",
    overview: "The sound of the pig is one of its important signs, which can reflect various states such as hunger, pain or emotional state, and directly indicates the growth and health status of the pig. Existing speech recognition methods usually start with spectral features. The use of spectrograms to achieve classification of different speech sounds, while working well, may not be the best approach for solving such tasks with single-dimensional feature input. Based on the above assumptions, in order to more accurately grasp the situation of pigs and take timely measures to ensure the health status of pigs, this paper proposes a pig sound classification method based on the dual role of signal spectrum and speech. Spectrograms can visualize information about the characteristics of the sound under different time periods. The audio data are introduced, and the spectrogram features of the model input as well as the audio time-domain features are complemented with each other and passed into a pre-designed parallel network structure. The network model with the best results and the classifier were selected for combination. An accuracy of 93.39% was achieved on the pig speech classification task, while the AUC also reached 0.99163, demonstrating the superiority of the method. This study contributes to the direction of computer vision and acoustics by recognizing the sound of pigs. In addition, a total of 4,000 pig sound datasets in four categories are established in this paper to provide a research basis for later research scholars.",

    overview: "In this paper, we propose a maverick stock trading strategy and apply it to the Chinese stock market. We use a high-frequency trade data of Chinese stock market in 2019 and apply the trading strategy every day. Data comes from the CSMAR database. Our trading strategy shows an amazingly high return. We further find that the strategy behaves better when trade in all the markets together. When trading in different markets respectively, the return is still much higher than the market index's return, where the highest return appears in the GEM market. This paper provides a new perspective of stock trading.",

    description: "",
    overview: "This paper investigates the effects of school attendance boundary (SAB) rezoning on housing prices and Students' Academic Performance. Using geospatial data and machine learning techniques, we adjust and classify boundary changes to identify patterns in housing market responses and demographic shifts. By applying causal inference frameworks, the study evaluates whether SAB adjustments lead to increased economic and racial integration or exacerbate segregation. Preliminary findings suggest that rezoning significantly influences housing prices and community composition, providing critical insights for policymakers to design equitable and effective boundary policies. The research contributes to understanding the interplay between education policies and broader social dynamics.",

This study examines its causal impact on housing prices, exploring whether sudden cash inflows affect local property values, housing demand, and neighborhood dynamics. Using a Difference-in-Differences (DID) approach, this research compares housing price trends in areas where residents win large versus small prizes before and after lottery payouts.

ESAs are publicly funded, government-authorized savings accounts that parents can use for various educational expenses, including tuition, tutoring, online education programs, special education therapies, textbooks, and, in some cases, college savings. Currently, there are 19 ESA programs across 17 states in the U.S., with variations in eligibility criteria and implementation.",
